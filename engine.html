	   <p class="p1">Aircraft engines are one of the most important parts of an airplance
	   if not the most important. Engines are essential to flight, as they provide power
	   in order to produce lift needed for flight. One engine that really impacted the world is the gas turbine engine.
	   </p>
	   <p class="p2"> There are many types of aircraft engines in use today. Most of these engines
	   are split into two categories. These categories are the Gas Turbine Engines and the Reciprocating Engines. Both of these engines have helped to connect the world in the past century.
	   That being stated, both types of engines have their uses and their fallbacks. However we will be giving our attention to the GTEs.

	        <h2>Types of Aircraft Engines</h2>
			<h3>There are 4 types of Gas Turbine Engines<em></em></h3>
	    </hgroup>
	   
	   <img src="manshers1.github.io/engines4.jpg" alt="gas turbine" id= "GTE" />
	   <p class="p3"> The 4 types of GTEs are the turbofan, turboprop, turbojet, and turboshaft.
	   </p>
	   
	   <ul id="gtes">
	     <p class="p4"><strong>There are multiple parts to a GTE engine. The most commom sections that most GTEs include are</strong>
		 </p>
		 <li><strong><em>The intake.</em></strong></li>This can be considered the entrance of the engine. It is where the air enters the engine.
		 <li><strong><em>The compressor.</em></strong></li>The compressor section is where the air that enters the engine is compressed so that the velocity of the air decreases and the pressure increases. This helps in providing more power when ignition occurs.
		 <li><strong><em>The diffuser.</em></strong></li> The diffuser section is used to further decrease velocity and increase pressure, this usually includes the use of sharp turns in the contour.
		 <li><strong><em>The combustion chamber.</em></strong></li>In the combustion chamber is where the ignition occurs. Some of the air from the intake is sent to the combustion chamber to mix with the fuel and then it is ignited through the use of an ignition plug. 
		 <li><strong><em>The turbine.</em></strong></li> The turbine is the so called "wheel" that recieves the hot gases full of potential power and utilizes them to spin. The turbine is connected directly to the compressor through the use of a spool.
		 <li><strong><em>The exhaust.</em></strong></li>The exhaust section is designed to collect all the exhaust gases coming from the turbine and putting them into a single stream, which allows more propulsion. Some aircrafts, such as military fighter planes have exhaust systems which allow afterburners for extra speed.
		</ul> 
	<h3>Turbofan</h3>
	    <p class="p5"> The turbofan is the most commanly used engine in commercial flights. Turbofans work by attaching a ducted fan to the front of a turbojet engine. The fan creates additional thrust, helps cool the engine, and lowers the noise output of the engine. The turbofan does not go over the speed of sound, or mach 1, hence it is not used on military fighter jets.
	    </p>

	<h3>Turboprop</h3>
		<p class="p6"> Similar to the turbofan, the turboprop attaches a propeller to the gas turbine engine using a gear-box. The gear-box slows down the spinning of the shaft using gears that become smaller and smaller. The smallest gear is then connected to the propeller. The propeller rotates through the air and produces thrust. 
	    </p>
	<img src="manshers1.github.io/engines6.jpg" alt="turboprop" id= "tProp" />	
	<h3>Turboshaft</h3>
		<p class="p7"> Turboshaft engines are primarily used on helicopters. The biggest difference between turboshafts and turbojets is that turboshaft engines use the majority of their power to turn a turbine, rather than produce thrust out the back of the engine. The turbine in turn turns the power shaft which connects to the rotor blade transmission. The transmission transfer the rotation from the shaft to the rotor blade at the right rate which allows the helicopter to operate safely.
	    </p> 
	<img src="manshers1.github.io/engines8.jpg" alt="turboshaft" id= "tShaft" />	
	<h3>Turbojet</h3>
		<p class="p8"> The turbojet engine utilizes the main parts of the GTE in order to propel the gases out of the engine at a high rate in order to generate propulsion. The turbojet is used on most military jets due to it being a extremely streamline engine and creating very minimal drag in terms of its power output. Due to its extremely high power output, the fuel consumption of the turbojet is considerably higher than the rest of the GTEs.
		</p>
	<img src="manshers1.github.io/engines5.jpgg" alt="turbojet" id= "tJet" />
	
	<p class="p9"> Gas turbine engines have come a long way in the past 100 years. And while turbojets, turboprops, turbofans and turboshafts all have their differences, they way they produce power is essentially the same: intake, compression, power, and exhaust.
